         <br> Chairperson's Note

        The multidisciplinary approach to Population Sciences has gained increasing practical relevance in recent times.
        For Bangladesh, although many challenges remain, successive successes in several population related programs
        have brought international laurels and attention over the past few years. Recent developments and challenges in
        the population field have increased the need for professionals who can critically analyze population issues and
        steer various population related programs. <br> <br>

        To address the need of the times, we are proud to lead the way by introducing this 21st century academic program
        with forward looking fields of concentration in areas such as demographic analysis; population studies;
        population and development; sexual and reproductive health and rights; population policy, program and
        management; food security and nutrition; gender issues; population ageing; and climate change adaptation and
        risk reduction. <br> <br>

        We are encouraged by the prospects which lie ahead. Students and professionals from fields as diverse as
        environment to medicine, engineering to sociology, business to women's studies, economics to geography, law to
        NGO management, both at home and abroad, have expressed keen interest in our program. We here at the Department
        are eager to live up to the expectations that have built up around us. In response to the diverse streams of
        students, we have put together a pool of faculty and adjunct faculty who have enriched our program with the
        breadth and depth of their knowledge and experience.
        <summary>
            Summary: Our survey of population related organizations gives us reasons to believe that there are many opportunities
            for rewarding careers in these organizations for the right person. While we promise to deliver on an
            intellectually challenging academic program for our students, at the same time we are mindful that our
            training should open up stimulating career paths in population and development related disciplines.
            Candidates who wish to take on the intellectual challenge of our program, and who seek a career path that at
            the same time contributes to society, are strongly encouraged to apply.
