    <h2>
        Introduction:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The proportion of the aged population in Bangladesh is higher than ever and it has been increasing day by day.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Socio-demographic situation of the aged population in Bangladesh:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The increasing number of the aged population resulted from demographic transition in Bangladesh has created a
        complex socio-demographic situation of elderly population in the country. To understand the socio-demographic
        situation of this portion of the population it is essential to go through the different socio-demographic
        situation of the elderly population. Hence, in my paper I am going to describe the socio-demographic situation
        of the aged population in Bangladesh through the discussion of the following variables.
        <h3>Size and Structure:</h3> <p>
            By the year 2019 the number of aged population (60 years old and above) in Bangladesh has
            surpassed 13 million, which is predicted to be over 36 million by the year 2050 (AgeingAsia.org, n.d.) The 2011
            census data show that the number of 60 years old above male and female is 5724975 and 5044525 where the male
            elderly to female elderly ratio is 113.4 (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2012). The portion of aged people in
            the population is 7.9% (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2019).
        </p>
        <h3>Distribution:</h3> <p>
            Age distribution of elderly regarding male and female in Bangladesh is very similar. Among the
            age groups of elderly, 60-64 year age group possess the bulk percentage of total elderly population with 37% of
            elderly belong to the age group, where 65-69, 70-74 and 75+ age group possess respectively 21, 20 and 22 percent
            of total elderly in the country (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2015).

            <dd>The multidisciplinary approach to Population Sciences has gained increasing practical relevance in recent times. For Bangladesh, although many challenges remain, successive successes in several population related programs have brought international laurels and attention over the past few years. Recent developments and challenges in the population field have increased the need for professionals who can critically analyze population issues and steer various population related programs.</dd>

                <dd>
                    To address the need of the times, we are proud to lead the way by introducing this 21st century academic program with forward looking fields of concentration in areas such as demographic analysis; population studies; population and development; sexual and reproductive health and rights; population policy, program and management; food security and nutrition; gender issues; population ageing; and climate change adaptation and risk reduction strategies.
                    
                </dd>
                <dd>We are encouraged by the prospects which lie ahead. Students and professionals from fields as diverse as environment to medicine, engineering to sociology, business to women's studies, economics to geography, law to NGO management, both at home and abroad, have expressed keen interest in our program. We here at the Department are eager to live up to the expectations that have built up around us. In response to the diverse streams of students, we have put together a pool of faculty and adjunct faculty who have enriched our program with the breadth and depth of their knowledge and experience.</dd>
                
                <dd>Our survey of population related organizations gives us reasons to believe that there are many opportunities for rewarding careers in these organizations for the right person. While we promise to deliver on an intellectually challenging academic program for our students, at the same time we are mindful that our training should open up stimulating career paths in population and development related disciplines. Candidates who wish to take on the intellectual challenge of our program, and who seek a career path that at the same time contributes to society, are strongly encouraged to apply</dd>.
